The following tools need to be installed on your system for the script to run properly.
They are normally pre-installed in almost all desktop distros. So, you don't need to worry.

This file is however useful for cases the script does not work, or you want to know what tools does this use.

	bash, sed, grep (with regex support), apt, gsettings-desktop-schemas (that's what you access indirectly in network manager).

That's all.
You could let me know in case there are any suggestions, bugs, issues. :)
